        <h3>Meanwhile, let's talk about my experience learning HTML5, shaw we?</h3>
         <p>Let's be honest, it's not that easy to start learning something like this, and sometimes the overwhelming amount of resources available can be hardly distracting to a beginner. I remember like yesterday how lost I was when I started to learn markup languages with no previous experience with coding whatsoever. The first websites I went through were H3Schools and mdn, but for someone with a pinch of background, e.g., students from computer science or software engineering, might still find those resources hard to follow, not because it is difficult, but it is hard to keep self-motivation after the first obstacles. </p>
         <p>Of course, there're people around the globe with very different personalities than mine, and frankly, I'm glad because it could be a disaster having more of me out there. Gladly, I overcame the first zillion obstacles before conveying them to you, and I'd like to give you some tips and share funny stories altogether.</p>
         <p>First of all, the's find some ground rules to learn how to code!</p>
